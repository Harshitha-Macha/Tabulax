# TabulaX
TabulaX Multi-Class Table Transformations using LLM

Built a framework leveraging Large Language Models to transform heterogeneous tabular data, 
classifying tables into string-based, numerical, algorithmic, and general types.

• Generated interpretable transformation functions (e.g., Python code, numeric formulas) for transparency and usability.

• Achieved superior accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets, supporting 
complex transformations, data imputation, and anomaly detection.

• Enabled scalable data integration for applications like heterogeneous table joins, suitable for analysts 
and digital assistants.

• Publicly shared resources, including code and datasets, to foster research and collaboration.
